# WHAT ABOUT " ON THE ROAD JS "

-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------

## I- THE STORY

WHAT IS THIS NAME

ON THE ROAD JS came to me because, from my teenage years until 2018, I had organizational problems,
which I was not necessarily aware of. After a second experience with a disastrous entrepreneurship failure (2013-2016)I started questioning myself about what was wrong with me ? What could I do to succeed ?
How could I earn money and live an happy life ? how my organization could be perfect to make money?
How could I unleash the beast...

-------------------------------------

I learned about personal development through a friend, before a very big descent into hell. 
Suddenly, depression, separation, depression again, debts etc. Then, in 2020, I decided to take
control of myself and everything I have seen and understood since 2013 came back to me. So, I took a long
breath then started to move forward as hard as possible, by perfecting myself in typist, English, fitness,
healthy food...

-------------------------------------

So, I take a few months to train myself in everything related to JavaScript. I start to create Excel files
for organization, motivation. Then, I try to know and gather all the information on each element that could
allow me to learn all JavaScript as cleanly and quickly as possible. I looked at job offers, companies that
are recruiting, I found out about salaries, how to become a freelancer, self training ways, advantages and disadvantages to work as a developper, as well as the most important parts to master in order to become a
very good Front-End developer

-------------------------------------

I grouped everything together in a Word file first, then I started. I created a local project "Youcode.js",
which was supposed to help people who are just starting out so that they do not waste time in research, that
they have a development environment, as well as all the information on the same website. After some thoughts
hmmm, I found out that this kind of project already existed. There is udemy, codecademy etc. Ok so, finally I keep it to
store and display everything I learn. Moreover, rather than stupidly storing bits of code, I create visual
blocks in order to use some of them, in others professional projects. It's my bible in a way.
(
    CSS,
    Grid,
    FlexBox,
    javascript() {
        [variables, fonctions, loops, conditions, arrays, functional programming, js methods(), DOM, etc.]
    }
)

-------------------------------------

From this mini experience with "Youcode.js", I started a new local site in order to refocus on the essentials.
I have a local site in which I store everything I learn, so my new site contains at first, youtube links, free code camp, Udemy to practice. Then, to motivate myself, I decide to add prompts, then alerts according to the elements of responses provided by me.
(
    how many hours of sleep the day before,
    how many hours of sport
    how many hours of free code camp etc...
)
... SHORT I'm really getting started.

-------------------------------------

finally, the title "ON THE ROAD JS", represents this second wind, this return to the saddle, this desire to go
to the end of things to become better for me.

-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------

FOR WHO ?

First for me, in order to have all the links and information I need to motivate myself and work properly.
For recruiters so they can see what I've been working on while learning and practising. They will be able to see
my code as well as the regularity of my pushes on github.

-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------

WHY ?

I created this project to force myself to develop a very strong learning routine, to spend more time practicing
rather than just theory. I also need to see my evolutions, so the charts and the reports on the platform are updated immediately,
and allows me to see where I am in my learning evolutions. In addition, I can reuse everything I have learned to build the project, list the bits of ghost codes that are likely to be reused on other projects, I can learn to create a clean architecture, learn to factorize my
code, progress in algorithms and in project organization.

-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------

HOW ?

By proceeding in an evolutionary way, I created this project while learning, while taking tutorials or reading articles. And i use
Git for my project and also to put my knowledge at the service of an exciting open source project

-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------

WITH WHAT ?

With my current and future knowledge, using online help platforms, forums, tutorials ...

## II- ORGANISATION & ARCHITECTURE

WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE ?

A basic site with a navigation bar, a subjective teaser image, blocks of divs one above the other and a footer.
It must be as quick and easy to use as possible, so as not to waste time looking for any information whatsoever.
It must be halfway between a showcase site of my skills and a professional website. It must also be 100% responsive.
