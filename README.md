# ON THE ROAD JS PROJECT

## THE PROJECT

The title speaks for itself, it is a platform allowing everyone to learn
the JavaScript programming language. The additional element is that the learner will have the possibility
to follow his progress, and know how to situate himself at the level of his knowledge, in relation to his research
employment. This will be possible thanks to precise statistics as well as a system of points allowing
to measure knowledge about this technology. This measure is based on the 10,000 hour rule
of Anders Ericsson, who says that it takes about 10,000 hours of practice, I mean PRACTICE for
master a given area. Thus, 1 point will be worth 10 hours of work. When we are passionate about this
we learn, 10 hours quickly passed.

The goal of this project is to allow users not only to learn and master JavaScript
as simply as possible, without having to search on many different forums and platforms, without having
lots of different tabs, without having to overload your favorites with folders of which 80% will never be
revisited. The user will have all the resources and tools necessary to progress and move forward serenely.


## WHAT'S NEXT ?
- Integration of artificial intelligence and algorithms capable of understanding the functioning of a single user (problems, availability, level of motivation, etc.), in order to guide him, to send him precise motivational messages.
- Consideration of equipment needs by setting up a marketplace for the sale of computer equipment, setting up a place where programmers who already have a job can mentor juniors or retrained people and participate in lotteries, including one part of the earnings will allow the few students to benefit from free computer equipment...
- An automatic search algorithm for video content of preference so that the study table is always up to date in resources.
- A completely responsive version


## HOW TO USE IT ?

### Homepage
You are on the home screen,
you can access the different sections of the platform by clicking on the links 'statistics - DReports - What's Js? - Lab Links - Your Lab'

You can click on the 'your todolist' button which redirects you to a page that allows you to create tasks, validate them and delete them.

You can click on the 'give me stats' button which allows you to enter information related to your learning times on specific topics, rest and possibly sports. after validating each field, your data will be saved only on your (internet browser - or localstorage & sessionstorage).
These backups during production time will be done like this. On the other hand at the launch of the platform, a database will be used, in order to improve the experiences
users as JavaScript technologies advances.

### Dayly statistics
allows you to see your progress through a graph based on 300 points (1 point = 10 hours of work) for the moment, the goal being to reach a score of 1000 points to master a given topic

### Dayly reports
allows you to see the number of hours worked on a given topic

### The carrousel
allows you to see the number of hours per day worked on the most important topics

### What is JavaScript?
Is a brief introduction to the history of JavaScript technology

### The study board
Allows access to links to practice on the main aspects of javascript, ranging from the simplest concept at the top left to the most consistent principle
at the bottom right. Viewed links are stored in the localhost for now (the browser), a counter shows how many links have been viewed, and you can see them, by clicking on 'view completed courses'.

### the lab
Here, users will be able to practice and see their results displayed. They will be able to come back here to remember what they have done or find solutions to problems encountered on other projects. This feature is under development.
